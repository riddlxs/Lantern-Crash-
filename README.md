# Lantern-Crash-
Lantern Crash is a one level prototype game based on Space Invaders. You as the player, must
shoot down enemies that are shown as jack o lanterns hurling your way! Every enemy shot down
awards the player ten points, and once one of the enemies hits the bottom of the screen where the
player lays, the player dies, the score resets and the game is over. The player must try to get as
many points as possible before the enemies hit the player! Do you have what it takes to survive?

Monetization
This game is free to play, as its main purpose is to be tested through by instructors at triOS.

Genre
The genres are action games, shoot em up and space combat. The game features the player
shooting enemies from a distance, in a fast-paced environment as they come hurling closer by the
second.

Demographic
E for Everyone. All ages are allowed to play Lantern Crash as it is targeted to people of all ages
for its nonviolent audience.

Features
Lantern Crash includes many features that reel in its audience. These features include the main
character moving left and right at the bottom of the screen fending off incoming enemies flying
from above in a vertical direction from the top of the screen to the bottom. The player must move
the character precisely to where the enemies are on the screen and shoot using the spacebar to
take them down. The main point of Lantern Crash is to make the jack o lanterns ship crash out of
the sky when the player shoots them down. The player continues playing the game until they end
up dying from the enemies. New enemies spawn every 7 seconds in waves, so as the player
continues on, the game gets progressively harder! The game loop of this continuous playstyle
drives players to try beating their high scores and engages them in trying to learn from their
previous mistakes.

Interface
The player interface includes A and D for movement. A makes the character go left, as D makes
the character go right on a horizontal pane. Lantern Crash is only available upon pc, and only
uses the controls listed above for movement. The basic movement makes it easy and accessible
to people of all ages and makes it very easy to understand. When the enemies are shot by the
player they disappear and new ones spawn every 7 seconds from when the first wave spawns,
and for every lantern enemy shot down, the player is awarded 10 points. 

World
The world features one level of a background of a dark black space, as the main character is a
spaceship fighting space jack o lantern enemies. The map only includes the backdrop of space, to
give the player an open feeling of actually flying a ship around. 

Characters
Characters include the main character spaceship that the players take control of, and the enemy
jack o lanterns. 

Music/Sound
There is some background music playing through the game. It adds suspense for the player and
keeps them engaged in the setting of space. There is also a sound effect for when the player
shoots the bullets at the enemy to destroy them. This once again adds engagement and transports
the player to the world of Lantern Crash through sound effects and music.
